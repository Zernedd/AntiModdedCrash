# AntiModded Troll

This mod was created because of the crashing issue going on in modded lobbies. This should prevent the most used modded crashing methods currently public and I will try and keep it up to date. 

You will know when a user is attempting to crash you as the mod will log the attempts.

Feel free to add a PR if you want a fix added yourself.

-Thanks Eve for the idea
